# Basic One-Way Example

This example demos a basic host application loading remote component.

-   `app1` is the host application.
-   `app2` standalone application which exposes `Button` component.

# Running Demo

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve both `app1` and `app2` on ports 3001 and 3002 respectively.

-   [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/) (HOST) surge --domain=taboo-stew.surge.sh
-   [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/) (STANDALONE REMOTE) dapper-cart.surge.sh
